Hi, just a quick update! I imported some of my favorite posts from my old Wordpress blog [Bitksel](https://bitkselblog.wordpress.com/), since I wanted to archive them here. The images wont show up correctly, however you can highlight the image link and open it in new tab to see it. Wordpress doesn't like directly linking some of the images it seems.

I will also keep up the Bitksel blog on Wordpress as long as possible, so you can read the originals from there. But just in case Wordpress decides to remove it all, at least the texts are safe here.

Cheers! Hope you enjoy my old posts. I recommend the "Ah, Morrowind" -post, it was written with love.
