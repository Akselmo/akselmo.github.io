When setting up my [ScifiFPS](https://github.com/Akselmo/Artificial-Rage) C/[Raylib](https://www.raylib.com/) project, I was having lots of problems with Makefiles. Apparently this is not uncommon, however I'm pretty new in C and makefiles in the first place, *and* setting it all up with VSCode was also a bit of a hassle. 

I however managed to get my CMake files work nicely with VSCode. Keep in mind this **has only been tested on Windows**, because as much as I'd love to run Linux as my daily driver, I haven't had the chance to do the switch yet. Also this was made for **Raylib** project, so you probaby will have to modify your build command etc. to suit your needs.

**If you just want to get VSCode to build your project using CMake Tools when you press F5, skip to section 4!**


#### Here's how I got VSCode build my Raylib C project with CMake on Windows:

1. First, download [CMake Tools -extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode.cmake-tools) for your VSCode. You'll also have to install [CMake](https://cmake.org/)

2. In the root of your C project folder, add `CMakeLists.txt` and copy the following to the file

    ```
    cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.0)
    project(scififps C)

    set(CMAKE_C_STANDARD 99)

    add_subdirectory(src)

    add_executable(${PROJECT_NAME} ${SOURCE_CODE})
    #Currently compiles only for Windows. 
    IF (WIN32)
        #ADD YOUR WINDOWS COMPILE COMMAND HERE
        #I used following for Raylib. 
        target_link_libraries(${PROJECT_NAME} PRIVATE ${CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR}/lib/libraylib.a opengl32 gdi32 winmm)
    ELSE()
        #Here goes other platforms. You can make your own for Linux and such. 
    ENDIF()

    target_compile_definitions(${PROJECT_NAME} PUBLIC ASSETS_PATH="${CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR}/assets/")

    ```

    And yes, I know I could have built the libraylib.a straight from source, but I didn't want to build libraylib.a every time I build the game. 

3. Put this in your `src` directory inside `CMakeLists.txt` file

    ```
    file (GLOB_RECURSE SOURCE_CODE *.h *.c)
    set (SOURCE_CODE "${SOURCE_CODE}" PARENT_SCOPE)
    ```

    This will fetch all the *.h and *.c files and link them to source code, so you don't have to type them all. Thanks to [GoldenThumbs](https://github.com/GoldenThumbs/raylibGame/blob/main/src/CMakeLists.txt) for showing me this!

4. To get VSCode build your project when you press F5, add the following to your project root inside `.vscode` folder.

    `launch.json`

    ```json
    {
        "version": "0.2.0",
        "configurations": [
            {
                "name": "Run target",
                "type": "cppdbg",
                "request": "launch",
                "preLaunchTask": "build",
                "program": "${command:cmake.launchTargetPath}",
                "cwd": "${workspaceFolder}/build"
            }
        ]
    }
    ```

    `tasks.json`
    ```json
    {
        "version": "2.0.0",
        "tasks": [
            {
                "label": "build",
                "type": "shell",
                "command": "{cmake.debugTarget}",
                "options": {
                    "cwd": "${workspaceFolder}/build"
                },
                "group": {
                    "kind": "build",
                    "isDefault": true
                }
            },
        ]
    }
    ```

    Now every time you press F5, VScode uses the Cmake extension to build and debug your project. 

### That should be it! 

Again, remember that the first `CMakeLists.txt` file I mentioned, the one that goes to the root of your project, you may have to tailor for your own needs. The one I copied there works for me when I build Raylib projects.

Also, **I'm new in all of things related to C!** If you have better ideas how to make CMake files, don't hesitate to contact me on my [twitter](https://www.twitter.com/akselmo) or if you spot me in Discord. I'd like to know and learn.

However I hope this is useful someone! Happy coding, and happy less-make-file..ing. *That sounded better in my head..*
