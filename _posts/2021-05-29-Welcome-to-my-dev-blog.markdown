Man this took long time to set up. I first tried to get Jekyll set up on my own server, but I couldn't get it to work. I also tried Hugo and all kinds of other website platforms. Setting up servers really ain't for me, but oh well.

Anyway, hi! I wanted to make a place where I can share my programming and gamedev related stuff. While writing this, I'm working on an RPG with Unity, and a small FPS with C using Raylib library.

Hopefully you will find this blog entertaining and maybe even useful.

Now I'm gonna go play something, I spent way too long setting things up.

Meanwhile you're here, check out my [itch.io](https://akselmo.itch.io/)!

Cheers!

PS. Don't change your github page theme through github itself. It just breaks the site.
