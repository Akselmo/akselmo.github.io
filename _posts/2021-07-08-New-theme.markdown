Hi! I made a new theme (or layout) for the blog! 

I used Minima as the base, then just edited the default layout and css files. Seems to work fine!

If you spot any problems with it, feel free to comment about it. 

Here's the commit and merge if you want to see what I changed: [Clicky!](https://github.com/Akselmo/akselmo.github.io/commit/b5b801136b6f74da58e604c22d44da072d49fbd8)
