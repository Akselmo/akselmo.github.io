                        <p>
                            Hi there!<br> My name is Akseli Lahtinen and I'm a 26 years old guy from Oulu, Finland. I have graduated from the following schools: 
                            <ul>
                                <li>2019: <a href="http://www.oamk.fi/en/" target="_blank">Oulu University of Applied Sciences</a> (Tradenomi, Business Information Systems, web-development).</li>
                                <li>2016: <a href="http://www.raahenedu.fi/lybecker/en/" target="_blank">Lybecker</a> (Media-assistentti, animation/game development)</li>
                                <li>2012: <a href="http://rpkk.fi/" target="_blank">RPKK</a> (Datanomi, IT courses)</li>
                            </ul>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I'm looking to start a career in game development/programming role, however I'm also interested in developing more general software and web-development. Basically anything programming related goes, but I'm strongest in game development and C#. Anything that improves my skills and let's me learn new things makes me happy!
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            My hobbies include playing and making video games, writing, cooking, playing with Arduino, collecting old game consoles and PC's and I like following space related news. Pretty much anything sci-fi or fantasy is close to my heart.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            On this site you can find information about my skills, past work experience and my own projects (mostly games) that I've made.

I also made a thesis about my work there which was mostly about UI programming. It can be read here: <a href="https://www.theseus.fi/handle/10024/261069" target="_blank">Thesis link</a>. The thesis is in Finnish, but I've also written it's summary in English. </p>

                        <p>Penance is my second oldschool-styled FPS game, where you play as reptilian templar, trying to atone for his sins. In the game you look for keys, go through portals and explore random generated levels while gunning down demons. I made this game just for fun and it took me 141h total to make. I patched the game based on feedback once, to make the game a bit more balanced. I'm really happy about the end result and it got 200 downloads, same as Ironscale, in only couple days, whereas for Ironscale it took almost a year.</p>

                        <p>Castle Rodok is my first proper, full length project that I finished in summer 2019. It's a dungeon crawling action-rpg style game, where player has to explore procedurally generated levels while fighting enemies and finding new weapons and armor. Eventually player stumbles upon a giant bossfight. Player can also collect books, which are saved and player can read the books any time they want from main menu.
                        Making this game took me about 4-6 months, mostly because I was working full time. It was really fun project to do and I'm really proud of it.</p>

                        <p>Project Ironscale is a oldschool-styled first person shooter -game I've been making for some time now. There is currently a demo version of it out for download, however if the game gets enough interest, I will start working on a proper singleplayer campaign for it! Highly recommend trying it!</p>

                        <p>Endless Arena is a fast-paced first-person shooter where you have to survive against endlessly respawning enemies. The game has "bunnyhopping" and "walljumping" mechanics. It was made for <a href="https://alakajam.com/3rd-alakajam/313/endless-arena/" target="_blank">Alakajam 3 gamejam</a> in around 36 hours. I made it alone for the solo division and I finished 9th out of 29 solo participants, so I think I did fairly well! I have also updated it after the jam to make it into a more playable game. As of now, it's in pretty good shape, and there's a really good base for making Ironscale.
                        You can download both gamejam version and the updated version from the itch.io page. </p>

                    <p>Crypt of Darne is a free roguelike-ish dungeon delving game, where you make a character out of few race-class combinations and explore a crypt, trying to find a specific gem. I began making this game for Games Made Quick 2017 gamejam,
                    however I couldn't finish it during the jam, so I kept working on it. It took me 2-3 months to make this game. I followed lots of tutorials and made all the sprites myself. In the end, I had +3000 lines of game code, so it
                    took some time to make. Crypt of Darne has been my most succesful game project so far!</p>

                    <p>Raptor Runner is a simple "endless runner" type of game. I spent about a month on making it. I made all the assets for the game from scratch: sprites, sound effects, music and of course the game code. I used Javascript and Phaser
                        framework for making it. This game runs in web browser, however there's a downloadable executable too. It also supports mobile!</p>

                    <p>This is a very simple small game I made one day in about 4-6 hours or so. In it the player has to collect presents in a snowy forest. The presents spawn in random positions every time the player restarts the game. I also made all of the 3D models myself in Blender, except for the dead trees. It was really fun to make and my seven year old sister liked it a lot so it was a success! :)

                    <p>We made this game together for web-project class for university as a 4-person group. It was made in about 7 weeks, in two week sprints (last sprint was only one week). I made half of the code together with one of my groupmates and the graphics were made by the rest of the group. The game is nothing big, but I'm still proud of the result. The main point of those classes was making a proper project and following procedures such as documenting and making tasks for each other etc. You can find the <a href="https://github.com/Akselmo/ProjectLASER/" target="_blank">Github page of the game here!</a> You can also find links to my groupmates portfolios there.

                    <p>Me and my fiancée Jenny made this one together during our internship at Snowgrains. It was made with Construct 2. Jenny made all the textures, animations and other visual things, except for the hovering platforms and bullets which
                        were made by me. I worked on the gameplay and level design, which was a bit challenging for me, since I don't play many platformer games. It still came out very well, and I'm quite proud of it.

                    <p>I made this game with my fiancée Jenny as our final project for Lybecker's gamedev course. I used UltimateFPS assets to make the gameplay itself (and the enemy model) and to learn how things work since I could look into the code.
                        Jenny made most of the 3D models, except I made the model for the main character. She also made the textures and main menu buttons. I mainly worked the code. Click the thumbnail for screenshot!</p>
